## Description 📃

Challenge 9 README Generator. Generate a professional README when a developer first create their repo by answering a few questions. The README will have a title, description, table of content, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions headers.

## Demo 💻

## Installation 🔧

```
npm i
```

## Usage 

After install dependencies, run command:
```
node index.js
```
Then answer the questions. You can't leave them blank, at least for question that you don't know how to answer, put N/A.

A sampleREADME.md will be generated. You can change the name later.
